### Timetable structure:

- Morning meeting: 10am - 10:15am
- Lunch time catch up: 2pm - 2:15pm
- Afternoon round up: 4:45pm - 5:15pm

### Aim to swap pairs every hour (this can be flexible)

### What do we need our Testing Framework to be doing?

##### Basic Features:
- See whether our tests are passing or failing
- Label for tests and referencing
- We will be using the equal and error matchers


Example Test input:

```
it('2 + 2 is equal to 4', function(){
  expect(2 + 2).toEqual(4)
})
```

Example Test Output:

```
Test: 2 + 2 is equal to 4
âœ” Pass
```
